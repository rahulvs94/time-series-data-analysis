# time series data analysis

methods to predict future output of time-series data:
(1) Naive approach
Assign last value

(2) Simple average
Average of entire data available 

(3) Moving average
a. Simple exponential smoothing
b. Exponential smoothing
c. Holt linear model
d. Holt Winter model  

(4) ARIMA (Autoregressive integrated moving average)
Finding optimal values for (p,d,q) to fit the model to the data
